      The search for humane, effective, and evidence-based solutions to the drug
      problem
    </h1>
    <p>
      By reviewing international experience and generating an empirical evidence
      base of credible information, the government’s antidrug policies can be
      monitored and evaluated for effectiveness. There is a growing body of
      evidence from all around the world that suggests that drugs should be
      dealt with as a public health, rather than law enforcement, issue. One
      study on 50 years of the global war on drugs says that it has failed to
      limit drug availability and that “global trends in drug use particularly
      high-risk use [have been] rising consistently over the past half-century
      and illegal drugs [are] cheaper and more available than ever.”
      <br />
      <br />
      Philippines needs antidrug policies, approaches, and tactics that are
      responsive to the emerging evidence from around the world and to the
      changing contexts of drug use. Instead of punitive approaches, the
      following may be considered:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Health-based rehabilitation programs adapted to Filipino culture and
        communities. These have been shown to reduce recidivism rates
        dramatically and to lead to secondary benefits such as community
        protection. These community-based programs have also been shown to be
        more effective in dealing with the majority of drug users who are not
        severely addicted to illicit substances.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Enforcement actions focused on reducing supply by investing time and
        resources on in-depth investigations that will result in the capture of
        high-level drug suppliers rather than low-level dealers. Any enforcement
        action, regardless of its target and the nature of the violation, must
        be conducted within the bounds of law and due process.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Reduction of demand by investing in prevention programs that are
        informed by a rigorous study of reasons for why individuals start and
        sustain drug use.
      </li>
    </ol>
