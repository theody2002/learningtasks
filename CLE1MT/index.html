      <h1>"War on Drugs"</h1>
      <p>
        Six years after President Rodrigo Duterte took office in June 2016, his
        “war on drugs” has killed thousands of people largely from impoverished
        urban areas. Extrajudicial killings by police and their agents have
        continued on a regular basis, spreading from the capital region, Metro
        Manila, into other cities and provinces.The impact of the “drug war”
        includes not only loss of life but damage to the livelihoods, education,
        and the mental health of surviving family members.
