 <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Rice (as much as you fancy really!)</li>
   <li>Half an onion (Or more, again if you fancy it) </li>
   <li>A tin of sweetcorn </li>
   <li>A few mushrooms </li>
   <li>1-­2 eggs </li>

</ul>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Start cooking the rice however you do, and put some oil in a frying pan</li>
    <li>Chop the onion into bits, any size really, doesnt matter particularly and throw into the frying pan</li>
    <li>Chop the mushrooms and add to the onions</li>
    <li>Once the rice is cooked, drain it off and add it into the frying pan</li>   
    <li>Tip the drained sweetcorn into the pan as well and stir it all up</li>
    <li>Break the eggs into the pan (OR beat them together in another bowl and tip into the frying pan) and stir the mixture up</li>
    <li>At this point, you need to keep stirring the mixture, keeping the eggs moving. Keep going until the eggs have cooked, should take about 5-­8 minutes maybe?
