        <h2>Neon Genesis Evangelion</h2>
        <p>
          The Evangelion series revolves around the organization NERV, using
          large mechas called Evangelions to combat monstrous beings called
          Angels. They are piloted by several of the main characters, including
          Shinji Ikari, Asuka Sohryu, and Rei Ayanami. <br /><br />
          While the initial episodes focus largely on religious symbols and
          specific references to the Bible, the later episodes tend to go deeper
          into the psyches of the characters, where it is learned that many of
          them have deep-seated emotional and mental issues. Through the
          exploration of these issues, the show begins to question reality and
          the existences therein. Much of the series's content was based on
          Hideaki Anno's own clinical depression.
